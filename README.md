# Print-to-Screen

## Brief
Much of the web is starting to look the sameâ€”so much so that we can often predict how a page will be designed at various screen sizes. This assignment will challenge you to create something you may not have thought of on your own and that you have not seen on the screen before. This will be an opportunity to utilize the techniques you've been exploring: CSS Grid, CSS Shapes, CSS Transitions, CSS Transforms, and CSS Selectors. This project will also challenge you to think about the relationship between print and the screen and what it is like to editorial design that expands across media and that is truly responsive to the amount of space available on the screen.
