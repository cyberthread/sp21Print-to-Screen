# Print-to-Screen

## Brief
Much of the web is starting to look the same—so much so that we can often predict how a page will be designed at various screen sizes. This assignment is meant to expand your visual design skills to create layouts that are less expected using advanced CSS techniques. 

We will rely on editorial design in print magazines for inspiration. The challenge will be translating those visual concepts, layouts and approaches to the medium of the web where page size is flexible and dynamic.

## Process
1. Familiarize yourself with the following texts to learn about more advanced CSS techniques and the types of layouts they can help you accomplish and to see how other professionals use inspiration from other media to push themselves to do new and innovative work on the web.
    1. “[Modern Layouts: Getting Out of Our Ruts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreccgYLfx8)” by Jen Simmons (Video)
    1. “[Influencing Web Layouts with Print Layouts](https://css-tricks.com/print-magazine-layouts-converted-to-web-layouts/)" by Chris Coyier
    1. "[Copy if you Can: Improving Your UI Design With Copywork](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/02/improving-ui-design-skills-copywork/)" by Erik Kennedy
1. Collect layout inspiration.
    1. Visit Penfield Library’s bound journal and magazine section on the second floor (if you are not sure where to look as a friendly librarian for help). The library has a number of options including (but not limited to): Life, Time, The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Harpers, The Economist, Art in America, etc. Look for editorial layouts that are interesting and inspiring in a magazine published before 1995. Find 5–10 layouts that you find visually interesting. Choose articles (not ads) that are at a full page spread (2 facing pages) or longer. If you do not have illustration skills, do not choose a design that heavily relies on illustration. Scan each page/spread of each article you collect.
    1. Review the articles with Rebecca to choose the layout you will use for this assignment.
1. Recreate the print layout you found/selected with your own content and imagery (or content and imagery you have the rights to use) in InDesign. Physical size, typography, layout, and style of imagery should match the original.
1. Translate your print design to a design that will work on screens. The character, spirit and main features of the original should remain intact.
1. Present & Document your work.
    1. Create a 18" x 24" horizontal print poster (no bleeds) that documents your project.
    1. Give a formal 5 minute presentation of your work to the class.
    1. Keep a timesheet (use the provided template) that documents each work session including the date, duration, and what was accomplished.
    1. Keep weekly log of your progress (log.md) in your GitHub Respository. Each week by Friday at 12pm you should update the document and commit the changes to include the following:
        1. Summarize the key design choices and revisions that you made over the course of the week
        1. For each key decision:
            1. include visual evidence (images and/or video) of the work you completed (especially any major drafts, including things like paper prototypes or sketches)
            1. Summarize the research you did around each decision and how your research informed your decisions
        1. Identify next steps including:
            1. What do you need to do in the next week to stay on track?
            1. What hurdles will you need to overcome and how will you overcome them
