# Print-to-Screen

## Brief
Much of the web is starting to look the sameâ€”so much so that we can often predict how a page will be designed at various screen sizes. This assignment is meant to expand your visual design skills to create layouts that are less expected using advanced CSS techniques. 

We will rely on editorial design in print magazines for inspiration. The challenge will be translating those visual concepts, layouts and approaches to the medium of the web where page size is flexible and dynamic.
